KEVIN WIECZOREK NEON QUAKE MOD

Neon Quake is a Quake 2 mod inspired by the game Neon White. In this mod, you'll fight progressively larger waves of enemies
and earn money to buy items and powerups. Each weapon in Quake 2 now has an additional secondary-fire attached to the right-click button.
These range from support moves to powerful new attacks. Mind the ammo, though!

-----------------------------------------------------------

How to Install and Launch the mod:

-Put the folder named kmwMOD into your Quake2 directory.

-Launch the game, and open the console with ~ key.

-Type "game kmwMOD" into the console. The game will then load up the mod. Start a standard new game on any difficulty 
and be sure to press F1 to view the help menu to help get you started with the mod.


---------------------------------------------------------

How to Play:

-When in you spawn in to a level, open the console command and type 'start'. This will start the next wave and enemies will begin
spawning.

-Once you kill all enemies in the wave, you'll be able to press 'z' to open the shop menu. You can open the console and use the
'buy' command to purchase whatever item is on the shop menu if you have enough money for it. Money is earned by killing monsters.

-Once you're satisfied with your purchases, make sure to close the shop menu by pressing 'z' again and type 'start' in the console 
to begin the next wave.
